# EV-D68 Nextstrain runs with ENPEN data from 2020-2022

These are the data, figures, and code relating to the paper ["Epidemiological and clinical insights into the enterovirus D68 upsurge in Europe 2021/22 and the emergence of novel B3-derived lineages, ENPEN multicentre study"](https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiae154/7637136)

Analysis of EV-D68 sequences collected by ENPEN in 20201-22 

This repository contains the Nextstrain augur pipeline output files which allow vizualisation of the result via the 'community' feature on Nextstrain.

## Code used

This was run using code based on the actively maintained EV-D68 builds on Nextstrain (live code [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/enterovirus_d68)). A release version which corresponds to the version used here (without paper-specific changes, see below), can be found [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/enterovirus_d68/releases/tag/1.1).

The **actual, exact** frozen code used to generate these builds is available [here](https://github.com/emmahodcroft/ev_d68_enpen2022).
